val argb: Long = red.argb // android compatible
```

## Samples
Please see more examples in the [sample directory](sample).

## Set Up Locally 
- The [graphics directory](graphics) contains the `graphics` library;
- The [sample directory](sample) contains sample apps for Android and iOS; plus the mpp-library connected to the apps;
- For local testing use the `:graphics:publishToMavenLocal` gradle task - so that sample apps use the locally published version.

## Contributing
All development (both new features and bug fixes) is performed in the `develop` branch. This way `master` always contains the sources of the most recently released version. Please send PRs with bug fixes to the `develop` branch. Documentation fixes in the markdown files are an exception to this rule. They are updated directly in `master`.

The `develop` branch is pushed to `master` on release.

For more details on contributing please see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
